# Test Monorepo


To migrate external repositories into it, including their history, you need to install [`git-filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo#how-do-i-install-it)

Once that's done, edit the script `incorporate-external-repo.sh` to
variables to match your target repository and simply execute it.
